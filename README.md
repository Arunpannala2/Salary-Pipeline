# Salary-Pipeline
Pipeline that extracts salaries and locations from Salary.com's website for various analyst and engineering positions, such as data analyst, data engineer, software engineer and data scientist. The reason behind this pipeline is to essentially have transformed/structured data which I can use to create an application with Replit, to let users estimate salaries based on position, experience level and location.
